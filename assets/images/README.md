# Home page images

Place these image files in this folder for the Home tab:

1. **background.png** — The dark textured black background image (full-screen background).
2. **logo-sipsafe.png** — The SipSafe logo (SIP SAFE text + orange checkmark), shown above the BAC gauge.
3. **cup.png** — The cup/glass image (with glowing liquid, no text). BAC % and "EST. BAC" are centered inside this image on the home screen.

Copy your files here and name them exactly as above so the app can load them.
